For this project the goal was to recreate the front page of google.com.
Implementing search functionality was beyond the scope or skill of a
challenge such as this so there is no search functionality included.

The most difficulte aspect of this project for me was figuring out how to
include the magnifying glass icon in the search bar in the same fashion
that it can be seen on the actual google.com homepage. 

I feel that I have a better understanding of have flexbox works though things
are still somewhat fuzzy. Overall I enjoyed this project despite some of the
challenges I had completing it.
